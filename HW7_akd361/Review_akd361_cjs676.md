### Clarity
1. Positive: I understand what you are trying to show me just by looking at the graph.
2. Positive: I require no additional infromation to see theunderstand why the relationship the graph displays is important.
3. Positive: Though "wordy" the labels and title are clear. 
4. Negative.  Graph could be a little bigger. 
5. Negative. Perhaps include the fact that the income is probably in dollars. 



### Aesthetic
1. Positive: Simple aesthetic conveys all necessary information without distraction.
2. Positive: I like the grid lines in the graph field.  Helps to understand the data. 
3. Negative: The axis labels seem weirdly large. 
4. I like that the axis dont include zero; that they are truncated. Some people might not like it. They are wrong.
5. I want to know the names of the towns that are the extremes.  Maybe just label those two. 

### Honesty
Seems honest.  People may complain about the truncated axis but it seems clear to me. 

### Conclusion
The graph was interesting and well done.  I enjoyed looking over the munging part as well so thanks for that.
