Worked on Assignment 1 with just one glance at Tashay Green's work to see how to find the intersection between a point
and a polygon. Otherwise did Assignment 1 on my own.

Assignment 2 I did with some help from Geoff Perrin. And I didn't finish the assignment.
Found the point of the exercise hard to grasp for a while at first.
