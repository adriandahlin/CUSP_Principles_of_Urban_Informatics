Question 1

Didn't work in a group but asked classmates for fixes at several points. Ian Wright, Scott Smith, Maisha Lopez, and others helped.


Question 2

Pooneh and I worked together on the second part of the Citi Bike exercise. We wrote the Authorea report together while logged into my account. She later added an additional figure.

# I am sorry but Assignment 2  is not good. The writeup has some flaws but most importantly wrong preprocessing of the data leads to completely wrong analysis. Please loot at the notebook where I redid the analysis (at the bottom) as well as the Autnorea article where I placed comments.
